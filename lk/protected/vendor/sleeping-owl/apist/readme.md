SleepingOwl Apist is a small library which allows you to access any site in api-like style, based on html parsing.

## Overview

This package allows you to write method like this:

```php
public function live_broadcasts()
{
  return $this->get('/', [
    'title' => Apist::filter('.live_broadcast .title')->text(),
    'items' => Apist::filter('.live_broadcast .post_item')->each([
      'title' => Apist::filter('a'),
      'count' => Apist::filter('.count'),
      'link'  => Apist::filter('a')->attr('href')
    ])
  ]);
}
```

and get the following result:

```json
{
    "title": "Live broadcast",
    "items": [
        {
            "title": "Microsoft Server App-V",
            "count": "4",
            "link": "\/post\/240971#comments"
        },
        {
            "title": "Education",
            "count": "235",
            "link": "\/post\/240421#comments"
        },
        â€¦
    ]
}
```
